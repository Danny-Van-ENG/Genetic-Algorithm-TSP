# Genetic-Algorithm-TSP
A traveling salesperson optimal solution by generating chromosome populations and comparing fitness values of greedy search, genetic algorithm (OX1), simulated annealing, and genetic algorithm with simulated annealing input.

# Compares each of the following algorithms to find the lowest fitness of a specific chromosome from a source node:
- 1: Greedy search
- 2: Genetic Algorithm (Ordered Crossover(OX1) with swap mutation)
- 3: Simulated Annealing
- 4: Feeding sensitive simulated annealing solutions into the genetic algorithm
- It is found that solution 4 will yield the most efficient cycle from a source node in a cyclic complete graph.
